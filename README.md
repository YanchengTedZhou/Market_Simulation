# Simulating Asset Returns Capstone Project

## Introduction
In this Capstone Project, our team worked with DUMAC, a professionally-staffed organization that manages Duke University's endowment assets, defined benefit pension plan assets, and other assets from a wide variety of sources. 

The goal of this project was to simulate asset returns with focus on regime switches and tail risk with intention to identify how markets behaved in the past and simulate their long-term behavior into the future to assist the risk-management decisions of DUMAC.
